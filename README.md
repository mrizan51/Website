## Claude Code skills

### 3d-asset-generator

A project skill that generates 3D assets procedurally from text descriptions
and exports web-ready `.glb` (glTF binary) or `.obj` files. Pure Python
standard library — nothing to install.

Lives in [`.claude/skills/3d-asset-generator/`](.claude/skills/3d-asset-generator/):
a `SKILL.md` workflow plus a mesh toolkit (`meshkit.py`), a GLB validator,
a GLB → PNG software renderer for visual self-checks, a drag-and-drop
Three.js viewer, and worked examples.

Use it in a Claude Code session in this repo — either ask naturally:

> make me a low-poly pine tree as a GLB

or invoke it directly:

```
/3d-asset-generator a toy rocket with three fins
```
